CHECKUP
initiate pointer, letter, nummber, oneUp
if (base Position == oneUp)
    dotCount++
    checkUp again using oneUp
    if (dotCount==3){
        returned true;
    }
else if (dotCount>0 and reversed) 
<!-- if up direction already have something, we'll check down direction, otherwise
just continue cycling through all directions  -->
<!-- if checkUp is actually called from a previous checkDown, we'll not call
checkDown AGAIN! -->
    checkDown using base position
else <!-- ie. if dotCount = 0 -->
    do nothing, continue cycling through all directions




we should reset the dotcount 
    at the start of a new count
or if it is not reversed
